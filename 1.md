## **Introduction**

Blind SQL Injection is a stealthier form of SQL Injection that does not directly return data to the attacker. Instead, it relies on observing application behavior through **true/false conditions** or **timing delays** to infer database information. This subtle yet powerful attack vector can lead to serious consequences, including data breaches, authentication bypass, and privilege escalation.

This post discusses a discovered **Blind SQL Injection vulnerability** in a web application. The issue was exploited using **SQLMap**, a popular automated tool for detecting and exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities. 

## **What is Blind SQL Injection?**

Blind SQL Injection is a type of SQL Injection where the application does not display direct outputs, such as database error messages or query results. Instead, attackers gather information by sending payloads that affect the application's behavior or response times.

### **Techniques Used in Blind SQL Injection:**
1. **Boolean-Based Blind SQL Injection:** Exploits true/false conditions in queries, observing changes in the application's behavior to infer data.
2. **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:** Uses time delays (e.g., `SLEEP` commands) in queries to deduce results based on response times.
3. **Out-of-Band Blind SQL Injection:** Leverages secondary communication channels (e.g., DNS lookups) to exfiltrate data.

## **Impact**

Blind SQL Injection vulnerabilities can have significant consequences for affected systems, including:

- **Sensitive Data Extraction:** Attackers can retrieve confidential data like user credentials or business-critical information.
- **Authentication Bypass:** By manipulating queries, attackers can bypass login mechanisms and gain unauthorized access.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability to elevate their privileges within the application.
- **System Compromise:** In some cases, SQLi may lead to further exploits, such as remote code execution or lateral movement.

The discovered vulnerability allowed an attacker to manipulate database queries via the `filter[event]` parameter, using **Boolean-Based** and **Time-Based** injection techniques.

## **Exploitation Example**

To test and exploit this vulnerability, the following **SQLMap** command was used:

```bash
sqlmap -u "███████" \
--technique=BT --level=5 --risk=3 --threads=10 -p 'filter[event]' \
--dbms='MySQL' --batch --current-db --random-agent
```
## **Command Breakdown:**

- **`-u`**: Specifies the target URL.
- **`--technique=BT`**: Utilizes Boolean-Based (B) and Time-Based (T) Blind SQL Injection techniques.
- **`--level=5`**: Increases testing depth to cover advanced payloads.
- **`--risk=3`**: Deploys high-risk payloads for comprehensive testing.
- **`--threads=10`**: Maximizes concurrent requests to improve speed.
- **`-p 'filter[event]'`**: Focuses the attack on the vulnerable `filter[event]` parameter.
- **`--dbms='MySQL'`**: Indicates the database management system in use.
- **`--batch`**: Enables non-interactive mode to automatically answer prompts.
- **`--current-db`**: Retrieves the current database name.
- **`--random-agent`**: Randomizes the User-Agent header to bypass detection.

## **Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions**

To prevent Blind SQL Injection vulnerabilities, implement the following best practices:

Input Validation: Rigorously sanitize all user inputs to ensure they conform to expected formats and are free of malicious payloads.
Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements: Use parameterized queries to separate SQL commands from user-provided data, preventing query manipulation.
Stored Procedures: Encapsulate SQL logic within stored procedures, reducing the risk of tampering.
Web Application Firewall (WAF): Deploy a WAF to detect and block SQL Injection attempts in real time.
Database Privileges: Follow the Principle of Least Privilege by limiting database user accounts to only the permissions necessary for their tasks.
Regular Security Testing: Conduct routine penetration testing and code reviews to identify and remediate vulnerabilities early.
Conclusion

Blind SQL Injection is a subtle but highly impactful attack vector that can be used to extract sensitive data or compromise application security. The discovered vulnerability in the filter[event] parameter demonstrates the need for robust input validation and secure coding practices.

By employing SQLMap and following a structured approach, this vulnerability was successfully exploited, illustrating the importance of proactive mitigation strategies to protect critical systems.
